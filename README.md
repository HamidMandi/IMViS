# IMViS Monitor
 high-frequency Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based Brain-computer interface (BCI) monitor
 
 Abstract:
 IMViS stand for Independent Matrix Visual Stimualtion. IMViS is a patented monitor designed for high frequency vistual stimulation that could be applied in SSVEP-based BCI systems. This repository is about developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for control  every single cells of this monitor. The program is a combination of Arduino, Python and QT and still developing...
